            <h2 id="part1-1">Research Insights</h2>
            <p>In this semester we focus on grocery shopping, looking forward to improving the bits and pieces of our lives. We’ve done sufficient research like academic literature and data collection to find out what makes grocery shopping inefficient and confusing. Detailed problems basically happens in three stages: finding goods, finding services and checking out.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Finding Goods:</u></strong></p>
            <p>- People want to find specific goods from similar items<br>
               - People intend to know the latest shopping information </p>
            <p><strong><u>Finding Services:</u></strong></p>
            <p>- People feel bored when they are waiting for services<br>
               - People are looking forward to experience comprehensive and flexible services</p>
            <p><strong><u>Checking Out:</u></strong></p>
            <p>- People are not willing to wait for checking out<br>
               - The self serves have technical problems which make users confused </p>
            
            
            <h2 id="part1-2">Main Problems</h2>
            <p>With the development of society, the pace of life is getting faster, and growing shopping demand of people poses a challenge to traditional shopping methods. People has been in the initial improvement of the shopping model, such as the catalogue guidance near the shopping shelves, the walking-around staff, and the self-checking out machines. But these methods do not solve these problems from its root. People still need to find the targeted products in similar commodities, waiting for the staff or checkout services.Thus, there is an expecting of new shopping way to effectively solve these problems. </p>

                 <td style="width: 30%;"><p>This application could make customer call for staff inside the supermarket and use online chat and rating system after purchasing to ask help from online service, with internal map of specific shopping map.

               </tr>
             </table>
 
             <h2 id="part2-2">Rationale</h2>

            <img src="img/table.png" 
               alt="This is a table." width=60% class="center"/>

            <p>This step of internal test aims to conclude advantages and disadvantages of each concept, through marking these three ideas.</p>
            <p>After analyzing and reasoning the scores, we come up with our final concept, a touch screen on a trolley, which users can shop in a certain route and scan the items once they get it. There are useful functions of connecting staff and finding goods to optimise shopping experience. After shopping, customers can checkout anywhere anytime through the screen.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of our upcoming new concept is to combine the benefits of our original ideas in addressing the basic problem scenario. At first, there will be a clear guidance for people that how can them understand and operate our application. We decided to keep the short tutorial from the Super Trolley as well as offering clear interface and languages options.</p>
            <p>For the overall concept, the device is expected to be portable, thus it can be more flexible in reality. Additionally, it will be user-friendly if we provide a double confirm or preventing mistaking touches function of the general system. However, it is also important to think about if our idea is actually practical.</p>
            <p>Considering the actual functions of our concept, we found the connecting staff system of application would be helpful as it is an intelligence device, because users may have personal questions. The scanning and route managing functions of Super Trolley help to save time for individual and also offers more customers to use it. Detailed functions of finding specific good and recommend options bring a better user experience as well. </p>
            <p>From previous feedback of our concepts we also thought about how to prevent people from stealing our device. In terms of how to return goods, there will be a return or cancel button. </p>

            <h1 id="part3">Design Iteration</h1>
           
            <h2 id="part3-1">Sketch</h2>
            <p>Sketch is the most basic and initial testing method,which mainly focus on contents. This helps designers worry less on design aesthetics and focus more on rapid formulation.("Why Sketching Is An Important Part of The Design Process", 2019)We can quickly instantiate our ideas and have an intuitive cognition of our functions and interface.  Sketch is also useful for us to compare different thoughts, learn about own design process and generate feedback. </p>
               <p>Following the flowchart of final concept, each group member uses pen and paper to draw their ideas about app interface separately. Depending on each sketch, we use user tests to obtain peer feedbacks. During a quick sketch test, we provide a printed copy of sketch, recruit our group members, and ask for their comments. Besides , scratch paper is provided for the participant to take notes on while explaining ideas. This feedback aims to help us rethink layout , text, content and function, improving the whole interface design. 
               </p>
            <h4>Individual Sketches</h4>
               <p><strong><u>Sketch 1(Mika):</u></strong></p>

            <h4>Inner Test and Feedback</h4>
            <p>Through testing, we found that “sketch 1” has sufficient advantages in page design and function explaining .Thus, we decided to use this sketch solution for the coming steps, also combining the clear structure of “sketch 3” and interactive button of “sketch 2”.

            <h2 id="part3-3">Testing of paper prototype</h2>
            <h4>Why we make paper prototype and testing:</h4>
            <p>Using paper prototype to test users is an effective way to introduce our concepts and get relevant feedback. Through it, we can see the rough effect of our expected results.In addition, paper prototype to different fidelities will receive different user feedback, which will provide us with new ideas for subsequent improvement of the equipment, further improve our new design and improve the user experience.</p>
            <h4>How do we do the testing:</h4>
            <p>Thinking-aloud, let testers directly speak what they are thinking when experience an entire new system, which purpose on letting developers understand the user's thought process and thus improve the design. We adopt this method in the test process, effectively understand the user's thinking process and our problems, and then make corresponding improvements to get the user's approval.</p>
            <h4>Test 1</h4>
            <p>During our first round of paper prototype testing, we found some problems from the user results.</p>
            <p><strong>The first big problem</strong> is that prototype is not completed in some aspects and some options have subsequent not been made, such as language, keyboard and tutorial.In the  upgrade process, we will further improve prototype and complete it with more details and contents.<strong>The second problem</strong> is that there is no feedback after the user has given instructions.For example, there is no change in the page when the button is clicked, and the location of the page is not indicated, which causes the user to be confused.Regarding this issue, we will improve prototype's quality and add some feedbacks, such as changing the colour of the button.<strong>The third point</strong> is the lack of detail in our prototype.For example, there is no user's or target's location in the map, which causes the page to look unclear. Hints and more details will be added in the subsequent enhancements.<strong>The fourth question</strong> is about the special needs of users.For example, they just want to look at a map, but the map we provide includes routes, which affects their viewing experience.For the special requirements of users, we will carefully consider the necessity of its existence.If this is what most people want, we will add it.If it's just an individual requirement, we might need more testing to verify its importance.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Upgrades</u></strong></p>
            <p>- Adding tutorial<br>
               - Using specific icons and title for each functions<br>
               - Adding feedback when users click icons or change pages
               </p>
            <p><strong><u>Upgraded Paper prototype</u></strong></p>
            <img src="img/paper2.jpg"
            alt="This is a wireframe." width=100% class="center"/>

            <h4>Test 2</h4>
            <p>Through our second test of 12 participants of our upgrade paper prototype, we noticed some problems which we already solved are still not perfect, while there are new problems coming out.</p>
               <p>First of all, most of our testers, even those who are not clear about how our concept works, are not willing to read the tutorial we provided. Thinking about one of the 10 Heuristics for User Interface Design, Flexibility and efficiency of use, users will not expect to read many content of every action on the system in the very first session of use. ("10 Heuristics for User Interface Design: Article by Jakob Nielsen", 2019) So, what we need to improve is to streamline our guidance.</p>
               <p>The most important aspect that keeps the system running, which is scanning hasn’y been highlighted. Thus, testers are hard to continue their action, and the overall process of shopping becomes confusing for them. In this case, we will protrude this main function by presenting contrast to attract their attention ("Design Principles", 2019), as well as adding more hints.</p>
               <p>We also noticed we haven’t thought about eyeflow before, while our testers wonders about the orders of buttons. Therefore, we will do more research of eyeflow and design principles to optimise our design.</p>
               <p>Last but not least, there are still some unfinished aspects, such as hints of no cash allowance and the method of item return. 
               </p>
               <p>Considering those significant findings, we decided to upgrade our paper prototype again and hold another round of test. It might be tedious, however, it’s helpful and essential to make sure our concept is logical and follow the usability heuristics. </p>
            
               <p><strong><u>Upgrades</u></strong></p>
            <p>- Highlight the main functions of our concept<br>
               - Changing the basic layout of interface to make the whole process more clear and fluent<br> 
              - For route managing, adding a shopping list to let both users and the system itself know what are the targeted goods<br>
               - Considering detailed and personal problems that users might meet and give solutions
               </p>
               <p><strong><u>Upgraded Paper prototype</u></strong></p>
            <img src="img/paper3.jpg"
            alt="This is a wireframe." width=100% class="center"/>
           
            <h4>Test 3</h4>
            <p>In the third test of our paper prototype, we received more possible feedback. There is basically no aspect making testers confused. The new layout is clear and every function is obvious. And they like the function of shopping list, which is convenient and easy to understand. 
               One tester raises an interesting problem: if he has already passed a target item in the route the screen provided, will he still have access to know where is this item? Or will the system still plan this thing into the route? Our solution for that is: if you pass any items in your shopping list, the icon/name of this item will change from colorful to grey. If you still need it, you can go back to the page of shopping list and click “resume”. In that case this item will be recounted into route. 
               What we will do in the next step is to add more double confirm or prevent mistouch pop-ups, to manage errors and make the whole system perfect.
               </p>
            <h2 id="part3-4">High-fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p>In the last test of high-fidelity prototype, most feedback we received are positive.Users are generally satisfied with our system’s colour combination and clear interaction screen design. However, the system still has some detailed problems are advised to improve. The typeface is changed from Arial to Open Sans, which makes the visual impression of our interface more professional and modern. The icons in this system are changed smaller, so the overall interface is becoming dapper and more focus on showing the main content. </p>
            <h4>Style and development</h4>
            <img src="img/style.png"
            alt="This is a wireframe." width=65% class="center"/>
            <p><strong><u>Why we choose yellow as our topic colour?</u></strong></p>
            <p>Yellow is a positive and bright colour, which is warm and easy to attract people’s shopping desire.</p>
            <p><strong><u>Why we choose Open Sans as our topic typograph?</u></strong></p>
            <p>Open Sans is a modern and neat typography, which is more professional but not too serious.
               </p>
            <p><strong><u>Why we use this layout in this system?</u></strong></p>
            <p>Smaller buttons is more suitable and readable in our design interface, which is based on a tablet device with a big screen.</p>

            <h1 id="part5">Reflection</h1>
            <p>Through the effort of the whole process of our design, users can basically understand the function and effect of our final interactional interface design concept. Also, we are willing to simulate what will happen after its actual implement, for example:</p>
            <p>- Will our device be suitable in all types of grocery shopping mall?<br>
            - How long will it take for a positive number of people to accept and use our concept?<br>
            - What we need to do to upgrade afterwards in order to follow user needs?<br>
         - Will there be a contradiction between intelligent devices and labour employment?<br>
         - How do we prevent uncertain risks such as stealing or damaging?</p>
         <p>Before the system is actually used into market, we intend to generate samples of this system and test them in some grocery shops, to make sure if it works as well as our expectations. For further upgrades, we will keep a close eye on this system and try to provide customers a convenient and efficient shopping experience.</p>
