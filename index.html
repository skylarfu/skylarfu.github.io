        <h2>DECO3200 Interactive Product Design Studio</h2>
        <h3>Design Brief</h3>
        <p>Given the outbreak of COVID-19 and the spread of misinformation that has followed, it is essential to provide an accessible platform where individuals can locate relevant, accurate and real-time information about the virus. In response, a website has been created with a focus on addressing the United Nationâ€™s key messages of common COVID-19 symptoms and how to get tested. This product is designed for ethnic and minority groups in Australia, who have faced barriers in accessing and engaging with information about symptoms and testing procedures. However, this website is also available to the wider Australian community and will ensure all Australians are empowered to engage with public health messages.</p>
